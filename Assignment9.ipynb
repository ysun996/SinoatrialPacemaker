    "To simulate stochastic processes, we need to generate *randomness*. Typically, this is done by asking the computer to generate *random numbers*. There are a number of functions in Python that will generate (pseudo) random numbers, sampled from various probability distributions. In other words, the function simulates a random sampling from a particular distribution. We will focus on only two in this course: the **uniform distribution** and the **gaussian (normal) distribution**.  In the following, we summarize some of the functions that will be useful in this context.\n",
